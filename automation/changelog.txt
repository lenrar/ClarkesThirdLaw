			[https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire/Apotheosis/blob/1.16/changelog.md](https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire/Apotheosis/blob/1.16/changelog.md)

		Apotheosis-1.16.4-4.6.0.jar:
			Added the ability to upgrade affixes! Items with affixes that are combined with an affix tome containing the same affix will now result in an increased level of that affix, rather than just the highest level of the two. Tomes themselves can also be merged, allowing for creation of stronger affix tomes before application to an item.
			On top of that, Splitting and Obliteration function on Affix Tomes as well! You are free to separate and level down your affixes to create the exact strength you desire.
			Also, the bug where soul fire particles showed up beneath your feet is fixed, so that's good.
			And to recap from 4.5.4, affixes are now far widely more applicable to items. Items specified via datapack will no longer check the item they are applied to, and manual overrides of an item's autodetected equipment type are now possible (in deadly.cfg). This means if you want to designate a stick as a sword, and let it receive sword affixes, you can!

When following the player, they'll cast a weaker version of the Sunblock effect equivalent to Regeneration I and Resistance II.

			* Added thatch blocks - New decorative block replacing hay bales in Barakoa villages. Can be crafted with 9 grass.
			* Adjusted Barako's stats and fight AI to account for Barakoaya
			* Made Barako's laser reach farther
