# Installation


1. Go to the [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica6) for the modpack version you want to install, and download the server files.
2. Unzip these into an empty folder.
   - Make sure you do not have this in OneDrive or another synced folder, as those can lock up the installer.
3. Run the `start-server` script and wait for it to complete. When the installation is complete, you should see a prompt to accept the EULA.
    - _Note: `.bat` files are for Windows, `.sh` are for Mac / Linux._
4. Once you accept the EULA, the server will start running. Startup will typically take 3-5 minutes.
5. When the server has started fully, close the window.
    - This works around a known issue where you cannot type in the console the first time you start the server.

## Server.properties

We recommend the following settings in the `server.properties` file:

```properties
allow-flight=true
max-tick-time=300000
level-type=terraforged
```

# Updating

## If you are hosting the pack yourself

1. Follow the Installation steps above.
2. Stop the server.
3. Delete the `world` folder.
4. Copy the `world` folder from your old installation to the new.
    - Remember to reapply any changes you have made to configs, whitelist, server.properties etc.
5. Start the server.

## If you're using a server host

1. Follow the Installation steps above.
2. Stop the server.
3. Delete the Forge jar and the following folders from the server:
    - configs
    - defaultconfigs
    - kubejs
    - libraries
    - mods
    - patchouli_books
4. Upload the Forge jar and the list of folders from the new server folder to your server.
    - Remember to reapply any changes you have made to configs, mods etc.
5. Start the server.


**If your old server contains the file `server-setup-config.yaml`, you should also:**

* Delete the following files from the server:
    - server-setup-config.yaml
    - serverstarter.lock
    - startserver.bat
    - startserver.sh
* Upload those same files from the new server folder.

_Most server hosts launch the server with the Forge jar. Steps 5-6 are only needed for server hosts that use the serverstarter script._
