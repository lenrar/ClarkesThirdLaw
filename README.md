### Clarke's Laws

1. _When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong._
2. _The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible._
3. _Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic._

This is a minecraft modpack that aims to have minimal bloat, while offering high quality tech, magic, exploration, and storage mods. This pack is configured enough to make the world cohesive, but not too much as to get in the way. 

There are quests (heavily inspired/nearly directly copied from [Enigmatica 6](https://github.com/NillerMedDild/Enigmatica6)), and custom resourceful bees (very much copied from [SLCP5](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/slcp5)).

This pack is still in the development stage, reach out or create issues should they arise.
